        <p class="lead">This is going to be a little personal website just for you and I. My plan each day is to update the clue for the password so you can get in, and then you can look at a reason that I love you from that current day. The plan is to keep this going as a list for a very long time, so you can always look back on it :)</p>

Even in moments where you might not be feeling it, I've always seen it. Jesus is evident in you. He has been since the day that I met you and His presence has never left. Your smile is where I see it the most.</p>

                <p class="lead">You are so gentle and take such good care of me, especially when I am sick. I'm thinking of the time we went to the big tire swing in Grand Rapids, and sitting on it for 1 minute made me feel like I was going to throw up. We went back to your house and you spent the next couple hours giving me Gatorade. Even from far away, you are so persistent in checking in with me. As I'm writing this, you just texted me asking me how I am feeling. You just care, and I feel very loved by it.</p>

                <p class="lead">You're really beautiful my love. In every way. I think I see it the most in the way that you treat children. You were so very clearly given the gift to work with kids, and I couldn't be happier that you realized that calling and are now pursuing it. God has you exactly where He wants you Ava. The picture is a tad unrelated, but I just like a lot. Even though I can't post it anywhere because it looks like an engagement picture. Maybe we will... have to recreate it at some point. Idk. I love you a bunch.</p>
