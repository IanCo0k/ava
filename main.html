        <p class="lead">This is going to be a little personal website just for you and I. My plan each day is to update the clue for the password so you can get in, and then you can look at a reason that I love you from that current day. The plan is to keep this going as a list for a very long time, so you can always look back on it :)</p>

Even in moments where you might not be feeling it, I've always seen it. Jesus is evident in you. He has been since the day that I met you and His presence has never left. Your smile is where I see it the most.</p>
